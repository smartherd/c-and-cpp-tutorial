## Chapter 7: Code Challenge with Solution 

#### Problem Statement 
A restaurant gives a discount of 10% if the total customer bill including 5% tax is greater than or equal to Rs. 1000. 

Write an algorithm and also create a flowchart for the problem statement mentioned above. 

Note: The customer bill needs to be entered by the user and total bill including 5% tax needs to be calculated in the program. If the customer is eligible for the discount, then calculate the net payable amount and print it. 
- For creating the flowchart, you can use a sheet of paper or any digital tools such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Powerpoint.

### Algorithm
- Step 1: Enter __bill__ 
- Step 2: Calculate __tax__ = __bill__ * (5/100)
- Step 3: Compute __totalBill__ = __bill__ + __tax__ 
- Step 4: If the __totalBill__ is greater than or equal to Rs. 1000 then calculate the __netPayableAmount__ (after discount price) and print it, else print the __netPayableAmount__ without discount.
