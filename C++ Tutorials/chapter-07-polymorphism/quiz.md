__Question 1:__ (3) A member function preceded by keyword ‘virtual’ in the parent class.   
- A function which is preceded by the keyword virtual is simply known as a virtual function. A virtual function is expected (not mandatory) to be overridden in the child class. 

---- 
__Question 2:__ (1) Function overriding 
- The concept of virtual function requires you to implement the concept of function overriding. 

---- 
__Question 3:__ (3) Function overloading 
- In function overloading, functions have the same name but different signatures (different number of parameters).
